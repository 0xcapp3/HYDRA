## What is an hydroponic system?
Hydroponics is a method of growing plants using nutrient-rich water instead of soil. In a hydroponic system, plants are grown in a soilless medium, such as perlite, vermiculite, or coconut coir, and are fed a nutrient-rich solution on a regular basis. This solution typically includes all of the essential minerals and nutrients that plants need to grow and thrive.

There are many different types of hydroponic systems, including nutrient film technique (NFT), deep water culture (DWC), aeroponics, and drip irrigation. These systems differ in the way that they deliver nutrients and water to the plants, as well as the type of growing medium that is used.

Hydroponic systems can be used to grow a wide variety of plants, including fruits, vegetables, herbs, and flowers. They are often used in greenhouse or indoor growing environments, and can be a more efficient and sustainable way to grow crops, as they use less water and pesticides than traditional soil-based agriculture.

## Components

A hydroponic system that includes a pH sensor and a BMP280 sensor, as well as an LED semaphore and an OLED display, is a highly advanced and automated system for growing plants in a soilless medium using nutrient-rich water.

The pH sensor is used to measure the acidity or alkalinity of the nutrient solution, which is critical for the health and growth of the plants. The sensor works by detecting the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution and expressing the results on a pH scale. This information is used to adjust the pH of the nutrient solution as needed to maintain optimal growing conditions for the plants.

The BMP280 sensor is used to measure the temperature and atmospheric pressure in the growing environment. This information is important for maintaining a suitable climate for the plants, as well as for predicting weather patterns and conditions.

The LED semaphore is an actuator that can be used to signal when the pH or temperature in the growing environment is outside of the optimal range for the plants. The semaphore can be programmed to display different colors or patterns, depending on the specific conditions in the system.

The OLED display is used to display real-time information about the pH, temperature, and atmospheric pressure in the growing environment. This information can be used by the grower to make informed decisions about the care and maintenance of the plants.

Overall, this hydroponic system is a highly sophisticated and efficient way to grow plants in a controlled and sustainable manner. The integration of sensors and actuators allows the system to be fully automated and helps to ensure optimal growing conditions for the plants at all times.

### Sensors
#### BMP280

The BMP280 is a small, low-power digital sensor that can measure temperature and pressure. It is commonly used in weather stations, altimeters, and other applications that require accurate measurement of atmospheric pressure and temperature.

The sensor is based on a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) pressure sensor, which uses a small, flexible membrane to measure pressure changes. The membrane is connected to a Wheatstone bridge circuit, which converts the pressure change into an electrical signal. This signal is then processed by the sensor's onboard microcontroller to provide a temperature and pressure reading.

The BMP280 has a temperature measurement range of -40 to 85 degrees Celsius, with an accuracy of +/- 1 degree Celsius. It has a pressure measurement range of 300 to 1100 hPa (hectopascals), with an accuracy of +/- 1 hPa. The sensor has a high resolution of 0.18 hPa for pressure measurement, which allows for highly accurate readings at different altitudes.

In addition to its temperature and pressure measurement capabilities, the BMP280 also has a built-in altimeter function, which can calculate the altitude based on the measured pressure. This feature can be useful in applications such as weather stations, where altitude is an important factor in weather prediction.

The BMP280 is available in a compact, surface-mount package, making it easy to integrate into a variety of electronic devices. It operates on a voltage of 1.8 to 3.6 volts and has a low power consumption of only 1.8 microamps in power-down mode. This makes it well-suited for use in battery-powered devices or applications where power consumption is a concern.

#### SEN0161

pH sensors are devices that are used to measure the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. They work by detecting the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution and expressing the results on a pH scale, which ranges from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 is neutral, while a pH below 7 is considered acidic and a pH above 7 is considered alkaline.

There are several different types of pH sensors, including glass electrodes, plastic electrodes, and ISFET (ion-sensitive field-effect transistor) sensors. These sensors work by detecting the electrical potential of the hydrogen ions in a solution and converting it into a measurable voltage. The voltage is then processed by the sensor's onboard electronics to provide a pH reading.

pH sensors are commonly used in a wide variety of applications, including water treatment, food and beverage processing, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and environmental monitoring. They are also used in hydroponic systems to monitor the pH of the nutrient solution and ensure optimal growing conditions for plants.
